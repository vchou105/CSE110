# Vicky's Page

### *Welcome!* üëã 
I'm Vicky, a fourth year at UC San Diego in Marshall College studying CS (~~computer science~~ cognitive science). I've taken a few computer science courses out of interest and decided to minor in it as well since I could easily fulfill the requirements. Due to the nature of cognitive science being more broad, it gives me a more open-minded perspective of many subjects and concerns in life that I think would actually be helpful if computer science majors took it seriously too. Like how Professor Powell said,
 > improving software development is **_not_** about the tools and techniques used by programmers, but the quality of the programmers themselves ...it's always a people problem.

 It takes a lot to become better in programming (or any career profession) and to do so, we also have to better ourselves as a human being. I think cognitive science teaches me a lot about human perspectives and behaviors that I never really took much time to think about due to other ongoing matters in life that we're all "busy" with, but those cognitive science courses guide us to question why we do certain things the way we do. Since computer science classes heavily focus on technical skills that are for sure important to our foundation to an extent, not much spend time on making us reflect on our attitude. With the exception of this software engineering course, I'm glad our professor is taking the time to pinpoint concerns that a lot of programmers make without reflecting on what they're actually doing so that we question our actions as we dive into software engineering careers. 


On a more personal note as a programmer, I don't actually have a _favorite_ programming language, but I do have preferences over others. I am most familiar with `Java`, `JavaScript`, `Python`, and `C++`, so I would naturally prefer these over other languages I'm less familiar with like `C`. Among the familiar languages, my preferences depend on what I want to program and which language would be easier to approach, but generally I'd choose `JavaScript` or `Java` as my first preference.

### Career Endeavors
Though I took computer science courses mainly to learn and enhance my understanding of what I really want to do, I could never be sure about my decisions until I really experience working in the field. More specifically, working as a software engineer in the industry could be drastically different from my expectation of what it's like to be a programmer just from courses.


I'm taking this software engineering class not just because I think it's a field I'm interested in pursuing, but also because I don't really have much foundation on software engineering principles despite having interned as a software engineer. I hope to develop a more robust understanding of software engineering and narrow down my interests within the field. Software engineering is a really broad field in my opinion, so I'm continuously exploring my path. I've mainly done web development in my career so far and am still learning more about myself, but I hope to learn from the professor and my classmates as I strive to further my skills and build a more holistic picture of my interests throughout my academic and industry experiences.

Some of my hobbies include:
* badminton üè∏
* looking at corgis üçû
* exploring local food and cafes ‚òï

Though I like looking at corgi (butts), I actually really like golden retrievers. I used to have a golden retriever when I was young - here's a [photo](Buddy.JPG) of him that I like when I sneaked up my camera while he was getting blown dry after a shower. 

I've made some achievements off my foodventure list this past summer at San Diego, but there are stilll quite a few I have yet to explore:
- [x] Better Buzz
- [x] Churro Addict
- [ ] Bird Rock Coffee
- [ ] Churros El Tigre
- [x] An's Dry Cleaning
- [x] Hanna's Creamery & Cafe
- [ ] Stella Jean's Ice Cream
- [x] Dunkin Donuts üòÇ
- [ ] Babycakes
- [ ] Cafe Coyote
- [ ] Tacos El Gordo
- [ ] Mona Lisa Italian Foods
- [ ] Sue's Korean Kitchen
- [ ] Charminar Indian Restaurant
- [ ] Aroi
- [ ] Eastern Dynasty
- [ ] Kangxi Is Coming
- [x] ..._and the list goes on_
